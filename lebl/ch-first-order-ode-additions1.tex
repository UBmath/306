\begin{example}\label{Separaeq:expogrowth} \textbf{Exponential growth $x'=kx,\ k>0$}
\vspace{5mm}

A culture initially contains 20,000 bacteria. After 5 hours there are 400,000 bacteria. Determine the function $P(t)$ expressing population as a function of time $t$ (in hours).
What is the rate of growth when the population is 1 million bacteria?
{\color{blue}
Round to the nearest $1000$ bacteria/hour.

\vspace{3mm}

The population is given by the separable DE:
$$P'=kP$$
with the IC: $$P(0)=20,\!000.$$\\
Solving,
\begin{align*}
    \frac{dP}{P} & = k dt\\
    \ln P &= kt + C
    \\
    P(t) &= P_0 e^{kt}\ \text{ where } 
    {\color{blue} P_0 = P(0) = 20,\!000. }
\end{align*}

To find the growth constant $k$:
    {\color{blue}
\begin{align*}
    P(5) &= 400,\!000 = 20,\!000 e^{k (5)}\\
    k &= \frac{\ln 20}{5} \, (\text{hr})^{-1}

JJ sig figs? trailing zeros give order of magnitude accuracy
BH yes- the trailing zero in 0.60 is intended to mean between 0.595 and 0.605.
Another possible choice would be 0.599, meaning between 0.5985 and 0.5995 and 0.5991, but 0.599 is ugly.
}
{\color{teal}BH The answer 600,000 bacteria/hour conceals the accuracy of the
result, and the $10^4$ matches the $10^6$
BH Specify round to the nearest 1000 bacteria/hour
so answer can be 599,000 rather that 600,000}
Then 
{\color{blue}
$P(t) = 20,\!000 e^{kt}$

At the time $t$ when $P(t) = 10^6$ bacteria, the growth rate of the population is:

A sandal made of a cedar was found in an archaeological excavation at Uruk in Mesopotamia. A radiochemical analysis showed that the sandal contained 54\% of the radioactive isotope ${}^{14}\text{C}$  present in a living cedar tree. How old is the sandal? Round to the nearest century.

and suppose $\lambda=0.00012 \, (\text{yr})^{-1}$ is the decay constant for 
${}^{14}\text{C}$. Then
\begin{align*}
S(t) &= S_0 e^{-0.00012 t}\\
S(t) &= 0.54 S_0 = S_0 e^{-0.00012t},\\
t &= \frac{\ln 0.54}{-0.00012} \approx \text{5100}\ \text{years.}

{\color{teal}BH Wiki half-life of Carbon 14 is $5,730 \pm 40$ years:
Possible values for $\lambda$
$\lambda_1 = ln(2)/5690 = 0.0001218184851$,
$\lambda_2 = ln(2)/5730 = 0.0001209680943$,
$\lambda_3 = ln(2)/5770 = 0.0001201294940$ 
In all cases 0.00012 is a correctly rounded approximation
but the $5135$ could be $\pm 35$, (say)
JJ Edwards and Penney use 0.0001216. Use $\lambda_1?$
BH Using 0.0001216 is claiming 0.00012155 to 0.00012165,
off-center and an interval of width 0.00000005 which is much smaller than the actual interval width 0.0000017.
Using $\lambda_1 = 0.0001218$ would be similarly
off-center and claiming too much accuracy.
Using 0.000121 would be not too bad, since
0.0001205 to 0.0001215 is pretty well centered
on $[\lambda_1,\lambda_3]$
and the interval width 0.0000005 is smaller than
the actual interval only by a factor of 3

\newline

An iron object at $400^o$ F is dropped into a large vat of water 
{\color{blue}
at $A=60^o$ F. 
}
After 5 seconds, the temperature of the object is $300^o$ F.
\begin{enumerate}[a)]
    \item Write and solve the IVP.
    \item Find the constant $k.$
    \item When will the temperature of the object be $150^o$ F? Round to the nearest second.
\end{enumerate}

a) The IVP consists of the DE $T' = k(A-T)$ 
together with the IC $T(0)=400$. 
Writing the DE in the standard form for a linear, first order equation, one obtains $T'+ kT = 60k$. 
Applying the method of integrating factors gives:
\begin{align*}
    r(t) = e^{\,\int\!p(t)\,dt} &= e^{kt}\\
    T' e^{kt} + k e^{kt} T &= 60ke^{kt}\\
    (e^{kt}T)' &= 60k e^{kt}\\
    \text{So,}\qquad e^{kt}T &= 60e^{kt} + C\\
    \text{or}\qquad T(t) &= 60 + Ce^{-kt}.
\end{align*}
Imposing the IC allows one to solve for $C$:
\begin{align*}
T(0) = 60 + C = 400,\ C = 340\\
T(t) = 60 + 340 e^{-kt}.
\end{align*}
{\color{teal}BH Symbol $r$ for integrating factor previous
No use of symbol $rho$ Suggest just $e^{\int p(t)dt}$}

b) The value of the constant $k$ is determined by the temperature of the object at 
$t=5$ seconds:
\begin{align*}
    T(5) &= 60 + 340 {\color{blue}e^{-k(5)}} = 300 \\
    k &= \frac{\ln\frac{12}{17}}{-5}

c) If the temperature
of the object is $150 {}^{o}$F at some
time $t$, then $T(t)=150$:
\begin{align*}
   60 + 340e^{-kt} &= 150\\
   t = \frac{\ln \frac{9}{34}}{-k}
   = \frac{\ln \frac{34}{9}}{k}

Before opening the parachute a skydiver jumping out of an airplane falls at an increasing rate.
However, air resistance creates an upward force which balances the downward force of gravity, 
resulting in a constant terminal velocity $T$. If $v(t)$ the \underline{downward} velocity of the 
skydiver at $t$ seconds, then $v' = k(T-v)$.\\

A boat has mass 200 slugs (approximate weight 6,435 pounds). The boat motor provides a constant thrust of 5,000 pounds force. Assume the total resistive force due to water and air resistance is proportional to velocity and the coefficient of resistance is 100 pounds force per ft/sec of velocity. Applying Newton's Second Law gives, $200v'=5,000-100v$ for velocity $v(t)$ ft/sec.}

{\color{teal}BH original problem had 6400 lb weight and 10,000 lb thrust, 
which is high. 
From Propeller Handbook, Dave Gerr, International Marine 1989:
For Svelte Samantha, 
a 34ft cruiser displacing 12700lb, single propeller, 240 shaft horsepower, 
cruising at 18kt=30.4fps, thrust is 2729 pounds.
JJ I had agonized over these values. I did want them to be plausible. BH The Svelte Samantha parameters with
mass 400 slugs gave rise to a solution involving 
$e^{-t/4}$ which is not as nice as $e^{-t/2}$ of
the original problem. So, changed back to mass 200 slugs
but kept thrust at realistic thrust 5000 lb force, to give a realistic boat (max vel 50 fps) and nice $e^{-t/2}$
}
{\color{teal}BH Conversion from mass in slugs to weight in pounds
involves a particular value of acceleration due to gravity:
slug has a mass of 32.1740 lb based on standard gravity (wiki).
Could use 32 or 32.2 or 32.17. If want both mass in slugs
and weight to be "nice", must use 32. We want the DE which
involves slugs to be "nice", so if use true value for 32.1740
the weight must be less "nice"}

\subsection{Sketching qualitatively-different solutions to autonomous DEs}
%\textbf{}
%\vspace{5mm} 

We are considering problems of the form:
$$x' = f(x)$$
where $f(x)$ and $\frac{df}{dx}(x)$ are continuous. The basic idea is that the sign of the function $f(x)$ tells us if
the solution is increasing or decreasing. This allows one to sketch rough approximate solutions with the correct qualitative properties.
{\color{teal}BH changed Lipshitz continuous to $\frac{df}{dy}$ continuous for
consistency with version of Picard's e/u thm in Lebl}

\begin{example}\label{Autoeq:sketching auto}
\begin{equation}
    x' = f(x)= x^2-4x+3
\end{equation}

\begin{enumerate}[Step 1)]
\item Draw 3 sets of axes:
\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
    \item $xx'$-plane, for the graph of $x' = f(x)$,
    \item a vertical $x$ axis, for the phase line,
    \item $tx$-plane, for the solution curves.
\end{enumerate}
It is helpful to draw (i) ``sideways'' as in \figurevref{logisticredrawnjr} so that the $x$-axes 
of all 3 plots are aligned.

\begin{figure}[h!t]


\centering
\includegraphics[width=6.0in, height=3.0in]{additional_figures/first_order_extra_figure_longer_time_update_202001.png}
\caption{}
\label{logisticredrawnjr}

\end{figure}

\item Sketch $x' = f(x)$ in the $xx'$-plane. Note that each value $x=c$ such that $f(c)=0$ corresponds to a constant solution 
$x(t)\equiv c$ for all $x$.
The values $x=c$ are also called  critical points or equilibria of the DE.

\item Mark the critical points $x = c$ as dots on the $x$-axis of the phase line.
These divide the phase line into subintervals.

\item Draw an arrow on each subinterval,
pointing up if $f>0$ on the subinterval and down if $f<0$.
%\item 
%For each CP, inspect the neighboring arrows on the phase line 
%and classify the CP as stable or unstable.
{\color{teal}BH skip classifying as stable/unstable}
\item
Sketch the constant solutions $x(t) \equiv c$ in the $tx$-plane.
These lines divide the $tx$-plane into subregions corresponding to
the subintervals of the phase line.

\item Select one IC $(t_0,x_0)$ for each different subregion 
 and sketch the corresponding solution.
Base the sketch on whether $x(t)$ is increasing or decreasing
as shown by the arrows on the phase line.
Each solution curve must lie entirely in one of the subregions.
It can be shown by using the Picard existence/uniqueness theorem for first order ODEs (Theorem \ref{slope:picardthm}) that different solution curves cannot intersect 
($y$ and $x$ of the Theorem correspond to $x$ and $t$ here, respectively).
It follows that each non-constant solution $x(t)$ cannot cross or even touch any of the lines $x=c$ because these lines represent constant solutions $x(t)\equiv c$.

\end{enumerate}
In the example shown in \figurevref{logisticredrawnjr}, each of the three non-constant solution curves  represents
a class of solutions having the same qualitative behavior:

\begin{enumerate}[1)]
    \item Any IC $(t_0,x_0)$ with $x_0 < 1$ 
    leads to a solution which is strictly increasing and asymptotic as $t\to\infty$ to $x\equiv 1$. 
    For $t<t_0$, the solution takes on arbitrarily large negative values.
    \item Any IC $(t_0,x_0)$ with $1 < x_0 < 3$ leads to a solution which is
    strictly decreasing for all $t$ and asymptotic as $t\to\infty$ to $x\equiv 1$. As $t\to-\infty$ the solution is asymptotic to $x\equiv 3$.
    \item Any IC $(t_0,x_0)$ with $x_0>3$ 
    leads to a solution which is
    strictly increasing. For  $t>t_0$, the solution takes on arbitrarily large positive values. As $t\to -\infty$,
    the solution is asymptotic to $x\equiv 3$.
    {\color{teal}BH solutions cease to exist at finite time, so as $t\to\infty$
    isn't correct}
\end{enumerate}
{\color{teal}BH strictly increasing is stronger than monotonic increasing-
the "monotonic" is unnecessary }
{\color{teal}BH removed erroneous "fix" of replacing (1,2) with (1,2]}
